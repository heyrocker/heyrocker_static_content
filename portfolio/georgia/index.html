<p>Georgia had built a digital platform to serve state agencies and provide a consistent experience for constituents, but it was showing its age. Their content architecture did not support modern omnichannel needs, editors wanted modern page building and file management features, and there was no coherent design system.</p>
<h3 id="my-role">My role</h3>
<p>I led a team of three that designed the new content architecture and editorial tools for Georgia&rsquo;s new platform, GovHub. I also acted as the representative for content strategy in a cross-functional team of developers, project managers, designers, and client stakeholders.</p>
<h3 id="what-i-did">What I did</h3>
<ul>
<li>Performed a state-wide content inventory, and developed shell scripts to break it up into different views by content type, agency, vertical and other criteria depending on needs.</li>
<li>Conducted interviews with agency content authors and executive stakeholders to determine common pain points and priorities.</li>
<li>Designed a content model consisting of 20 content types and 15 flexible components that would provide a balance between the need for structured content as well as the flexibility to work across a wide variety of use cases.</li>
<li>Architected a common taxonomy system that provided agencies with a set of common vocabularies that they could customize for their needs.</li>
<li>Prototyped and tested new editorial interfaces with authors to get feedback and identify issues.</li>
<li>Trained agency stakeholders in how to conduct content audits and identify gaps where content was missing.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>All 80 existing agency sites were cleanly migrated into the new system.</li>
<li>Over 40 agencies decided to join the new platform after launch.</li>
<li>GovHub became the gold standard for state government technology. It was awarded <a href="https://statescoop.com/bio/govhub-digital-platform/">State IT Innovation of the Year from statescoop.com</a>, and the Orchard design system was the <a href="https://gta.georgia.gov/news/2024-10-02/georgia-web-design-system-earns-national-award">top winner for the Information Communications Technology Innovations category at the National Association of State CIOs (NASCIO) State IT Recognition Awards</a>.</li>
